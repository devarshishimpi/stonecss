## Wait. Where is the framework? and where is it's source code repository? Why is the project archived?

Currently, the prototype is ready. I previously owned the domain name called as **stonecss(dot)com** but now as expired. I couldn't find enough time to continue working on it. If anyone wants to continue progressing with it. Hit me up on my socials in DMs/send me an email. I will unarchive it once development resumes in the future! Thanks for understanding! üôè

## What can we expect in the initial release?

Different components and templates to choose from ( Around 200-300 components ). Not too many at start. But expect it to increase overtime!!!
