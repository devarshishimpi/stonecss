    </h2>

    <p>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason

    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2><b>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
      </b></h2>

    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
      in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
      personal information:
    </p>

    <ul>




      <li>Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our
        legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
        legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
      </li>


      <li>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital
        interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety
        of any person.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2><b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
      </b></h2>

    <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
      personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied
      consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.
    </p>



    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
      your consent, including, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
      </li>
      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
      </li>
      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
      </li>
      <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
        insurance claim
      </li>
      <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
      </li>
      <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
      </li>
      <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
        accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of
        an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
      </li>
      <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
        the production of records
      </li>
      <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
        collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
      </li>
      <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
      </li>
      <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="toc5">HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
    <small>(If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to
      certain information about you.
      Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
      (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information
      about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social
      media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
      well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.)</small>

    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that
      are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
      responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
      that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and
      how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>


    <hr>
    <h2 id="toc6">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    <small>(We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
      unless otherwise required by law.
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
      other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
      than 90 days.)</small>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.</p>


    <hr>
    <h2 id="toc7">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

    <small>(We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
      measures.)</small>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
      the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
      be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
      parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
      from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 id="toc8">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <small>(In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights
      that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate
      your account at any time.)</small>


    <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.
      These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
      rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable,
      to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
      personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
      section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

    <h2 id="toc9">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
      DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
      that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
      notice.</p>
